# What is it about?

This is and educational site for learners. People who are registered and logged in, can do built-in (by admin) quizzes 
and also take courses and also create courses. The back-end stores the data of how many quizzes, coures (created or did)
they made, and many things as well that I will elaborate below.

# Distinctiveness and Complexity

##### Why I believe my project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements: #####

- My web application has different login, logout, register forms and apprehensions. Altough the learned methods was used
  by me, and always applied them when I felt the need.

- When the user was not logged in, when visiting the page, it redirects the user to the login form in order to use the equipments.

- The main site, the home shows the datas which was rendered using back-end django in that case. When clicked on the quiz it
  redirects to a new page where javascript shows with a control flow(condition) what to add to the page content, using DOM here.
  The Javascript looks for the form when submit steps into action, and inside the form it searches the name of the inputs in order
  to valuate the values put in them. A next (or retry) button appears according to the result. Meaning when clicked on next It 
  gives to the backend django the result to increment the given data. It depends on the context of course. This proves the complexity
  and distinctiveness of using back-end (Django) and front-end (Javascript) in this case.
